pool ladies and gentlemen Solomon craft
here is Solomon craft
I've been uh clean for two months
now thanks by clean I mean I'm not using
fluoride
toothpaste yeah I used to be a real
degenerate this one time I was driving
drunk across a bridge and I thought it'd
be funny to hit every single
construction zone cone with my car the
next day I woke up in a panic I was like
[ __ ] then I thought wasn't the booze
that caused this Reckless Behavior it's
because I brushed my teeth with Crest
this morning another time I was in
Columbia on a 3-day Coke Bender and
these ladies wanted more money I refused
so they beat the [ __ ] out of me the cops
got involved it wasn't very
good and uh it wasn't because I had
gripping addiction problems it was
because I brushed my teeth with Crest
that morning that's why every time I'm
having sex with a girl and she looks up
at me and stops and says did you just
come inside me I'm like oh [ __ ] babe
sorry I brushed my teeth of flua this
morning thanks that's my
time okay Solomon crap
is it craft or CRA craft like macaron
cheese gotcha yep welcome to the show
Solomon how long youve been doing
standup 3 weeks just moved here okay you
started here in Austin yes and where did
you move from a uh a [ __ ] canoe in
the Bahamas or something somewhat
accurate I've been on a monthl long or a
year-long motorcycle trip through South
America so I just got back here okay
that makes sense you look like a guy
that's been on a year-long motorcycle
trip through South South America yeah
how's that been going for you uh it's it
was going pretty good uh yeah with some
crazy [ __ ] that you saw how many times
did you get robbed uh actually I got
robbed zero times but like I said I did
get beat up by some escorts in Columbia
um yeah some stuff like that like women
women yes escorts escorts yeah yeah so
how did that go down uh well I was it
was sober uh for a month right been
going in and out of sobriety and I was
like let's do uh a month-long sober in
medine Columbia which is kind of hard
and uh and then I broke sobriety uh and
went on a three-day Coke bender and uh
these escorts beat the [ __ ] out me so
why did they decide to beat the [ __ ] out
of because they wanted more money and I
was like I'm not going to give you more
money you guys should leave and then
they got aggressive they wanted me to
leave the uh apartment and I knew if I
left the apartment with them I would
have gotten robbed or killed so I stayed
in and they started hitting me yeah so
with their fists yeah yeah with their
fists oh there on the back side of your
head on the head yeah chest yeah wow my
goodness how big were they oh they were
much smaller than
me uh not their thighs and ass but
everything else what's that was it hot
at all like I I was yeah I was I was
panicking I was panicking like I said
the cops got involved but only 3 days of
a Coke Bender in Colombia only three
days you look like you've only been off
a Coke Bender in Columbia for 3
days it's accurate it is absolutely
incredible do you play musical
instruments with a face and head like

talents uh not in the musical nature
though what what what other nature might
you have talents in um I I don't know I

fulfilling exactly the like the jokes
that I made about you when I first
started talking to you I said canoe in

for the what's going to happen so we do
the high school one I get pulled out of

to be the school shooter and I was like
[ __ ] and I was like I so I was honest I
was like yeah I I said
that and he goes do you want to do that
for for the middle school drill I was

class again and I got dressed up and all
the middle schoolers were in our like
Auditorium and they gave me a gun with
blanks and they told me just aim at the
ground don't and I was like okay and he

wild that is unprecedented amazing and
the [ __ ] so you could have just as
easily have been over across the street
at a dingy Sixth Street bar [ __ ]
standing there doing nothing and then
you would have had to drive home to
Indiana accomplishing nothing and
instead here you are yeah I don't even
know I don't even well let's figure it
out Isaiah you've only done standup four
times someone fell asleep on a baby
that's crazy the she bleeds a lot kick

favorite part about it set is when he

one guy in the back of the room that got
a bigger laugh than everything that you

not easy just starting out um crazy 23

like 40 bucks to fill it up the first
time and the second time it was like 40
so about 80 80 something bucks not bad
not bad to go from the [ __ ] top of
the country to the bottom where's that
been three times I haven't slept you
know Williams Williams thinking about
driving from St Louis right now he's

how long has she not been in your life

okay where'd she dip out to do you know
uh I don't know I I was like about 3 or
four years later I saw her at a gas
station in the same time town I lived in
so she was probably around but do you
know anything about her is she does she
do drugs or something no she's doing all
right now she's living with a sweet old
lady in her basement and just you know
how do you she's doing all right I see
her every now and then but it's kind of
like you just see her at the gas station
that's it yeah yeah do you ever talk to
her on the phone uh no not really no why
is that because it's I guess it's on me
now to kind of go see her and I just
kind of don't do it you don't do it cuz
you're like you left me at 12 I mean I I
see her every now and then but it's kind
of awkward so it's just like why is it
awkward it's just like we're different
people now that's long and gone it's
just like we're on a
different his material is all about
hating women too very yeah no I was I
was just getting to that makes sense
that you're going around kicking [ __ ]

would say this makes perfect sense I was
afraid of that and I had another I had
another bit that I had round up where I
was going to be like ah Mexican Casey

psychology is that your opening joke is
about a woman randomly falling asleep on

any connection here between your mother
abandoning you and the woman issues in
your 60 seconds no no no totally
unrelated no I get that no I I I get

traumatized spontaneous the type of
people that would get in their [ __ ]

curious may we can fix them
so we got any couples here tonight any
what couples we got couples here

you know this is going to sound bad but
women tend to send tend to ask their
significant other other hey so would you

Nukem little joke book
on to the next
one your next comedian doing an
uninterrupted 60 seconds we got to get
through it make some noise for Eddie
Lura 60 seconds by Eddie
[Applause]
Lura I've uh accidentally been working
in restaurants for the last 20
years I was watching a fat kid eat the
other day and made me realize that if I
have a kid I want to have a fat
kid because uh he's either going to
overcome heavy adversity and build
strong character or the little guy loses
a foot and we don't walk from the back
of the parking lot
anymore and it's cool if some of you
didn't like that joke there is a certain
type of person that normally doesn't and
that's type
[Laughter]
two I uh I also figured out how to stop
school shootings right we have to
segregate schools again
what you do is you take all the lonely
white kids with gun Fascinations and you
put them in their own
schools right in these schools all of
the teachers will be known
pedophiles because at the end of the day
School shooters and pedophiles are the
same they both just want to unload on
kids I'm Eddie Lura thank you amazing

doing standup uh just over a year now
