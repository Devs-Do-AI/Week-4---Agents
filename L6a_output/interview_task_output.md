**Tony Hinchcliffe**: "Hey everyone, I'm Tony Hinchcliffe, and I've gotta say, it's a real honor to be here on Kill Tony. I almost didn't make it because my GPS keeps insisting that my life is 'recalculating.' Let's give it up for our next comedian, fresh off their 1-minute set—give it up for [Comedian's Name]!"

**Comedian**: "Hey, thanks, Tony! It's great to be here."

**Tony**: "Alright, let's dive right in. You mentioned turning 30 and realizing clubs aren't your scene anymore. Is that because you finally realized that glow sticks and pacifiers aren't fashion statements for adults?"

**Comedian**: "Haha, yeah, something like that. It's more about the realization that I'd rather spend my money on something more substantial, like rent or a mortgage."

**Tony**: "Oh, I get it. So, you're saying you traded in the dance floor for a living room floor? Big upgrade. Speaking of upgrades, your bit about ancestry tests was hilarious. How's 'Pillage and Plunder' night going? Do you guys go full Viking and raid your neighbor's Taco Tuesday?"

**Comedian**: "Haha, no raids yet, but my mom is really into it. She even bought a Viking hat. It's getting out of hand."

**Tony**: "A Viking hat? Sounds like she's one step away from renaming Taco Tuesday to 'Thor's-day.' Now, you also joked about DNA tests not revealing common sense. Do you think your cousin will ever figure out that Mario isn't a real Italian role model, or is he too busy jumping down sewer pipes?"

**Comedian**: "You know, I think he's too far gone. He's fully embraced his 5% Italian heritage. Every family gathering turns into a video game."

**Tony**: "Well, at least it's entertaining. Now, let's get serious for a moment. What's the real inspiration behind your jokes? Are you just trying to cope with the existential dread of turning 30, or is there something deeper?"

**Comedian**: "Honestly, it's a mix of both. Comedy has always been a way for me to process life and all its absurdities. Turning 30 is just another milestone that brings its own set of challenges and material."

**Tony**: "Ah, so it's like therapy but with more people laughing at your problems. Last question—what's next for you? Any big plans or are you just going to keep milking this 'aging millennial' thing until the wheels fall off?"

**Comedian**: "I have a few projects in the works, and I'm planning to do more stand-up tours. And yeah, I'll probably keep joking about aging until I can't remember my own punchlines."

**Tony**: "Perfect. Well, I hope you find the Fountain of Youth at the end of one of those tours. Let's give it up one more time for [Comedian's Name]! Thanks for being on Kill Tony."
