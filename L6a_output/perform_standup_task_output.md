"Hey everyone, I'm [Your Name], and I've gotta say, it's a real honor to be here on Kill Tony. I almost didn't make it because my GPS keeps insisting that my life is 'recalculating.'

So, I recently turned 30, which is a weird age. You're old enough to know better, but young enough to make the same mistakes—just more expensively. Like, I can't go to clubs anymore. I went last weekend and I realized I’ve aged out of the demographic when I asked for a drink and the bartender offered me a senior discount.

Speaking of aging, my parents are at that stage where they're obsessed with ancestry tests. My mom found out we're 2% Viking. Now she insists on celebrating 'Pillage and Plunder' night every Tuesday. It’s just Taco Tuesday, but with more yelling.

And how about this—everyone’s into these DNA tests, but you know what they never test for? Common sense. I’ve got a cousin who found out he's 5% Italian and started speaking in a Mario accent. Every time he orders pizza, he’s like, ‘It’s-a me, Mario!’

Before I go, let me leave you with this: Life is short, so smile while you still have teeth. Thanks, everyone, you’ve been awesome!"
