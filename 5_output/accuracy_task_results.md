**Revised Recap:**

Hey comedy fans, hold onto your seats because the latest Kill Tony episode was a roller coaster of laughs and unforgettable moments! The show kicked off with the ever-enthusiastic Tony Hinchcliffe, who was in top form, hyping up the crowd and introducing the band with his usual flair. Tony had the audience laughing right from the start with his hilarious interactions, including a joke about how the band's attire made them look like a group of time-traveling rockstars.

The night's special guest, the incredibly funny Daniel Van Kirk, set the tone for an evening of hilarity. From the moment he stepped on stage, Daniel's quick wit and sharp observations had everyone in stitches. One particularly memorable moment was when he joked about the absurdity of modern dating apps, comparing swiping through profiles to playing a game of slot machines in Vegas.

One standout performance came from the ever-unpredictable Casey Rocket, who opened his set by humorously lamenting his bizarre diet, saying, "I eat like a raccoon in a dumpster," and reminiscing about old TV shows. His frenetic energy and unique delivery left the audience roaring with laughter, especially when he did a spot-on impression of a character from an obscure '90s cartoon.

Another highlight was Joseph Kirimi, whose jokes about his ambiguous ethnicity and OnlyFans past were both bold and hilarious. He had the crowd in splits when he quipped, "People always ask if I'm mixed. I tell them, ‘Yeah, mixed up in a lot of bad decisions,’ like starting an OnlyFans during quarantine."

The crowd also got a surprise treat when a charismatic audience member named John, a Trinidad and Tobago native with striking blonde hair, was brought on stage. His impromptu interview revealed some jaw-dropping bedroom maneuvers, including a hilarious demonstration of his 'helicopter' move, which left everyone wanting more.

The night wouldn't be complete without a visit from Kill Tony Hall of Famer, William Montgomery. As always, William delivered a brand new minute filled with his signature blend of absurdity and sharp humor. His jokes about OJ Simpson, including a punchline about OJ starting a true crime podcast called 'Juiced,' had the audience in hysterics. He also threw in sharp jabs at Joe Biden's public speaking gaffes and a nostalgic yet absurd take on Reading Rainbow.

The episode was a testament to the raw, unfiltered comedy that Kill Tony is known for, making it an unforgettable night for everyone in attendance. If you missed it, make sure to catch the replay – you won't want to miss these comedic gems!
