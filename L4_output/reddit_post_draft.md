**1. Casey Rocket's Set (Approx. 8:30 PM)**

Casey Rocket took the stage and delivered a set that was nothing short of surreal hilarity. He kicked things off with a bit about eating babies and holiday stressâ€”yes, you read that right. But the absurdity didnâ€™t stop there. Midway through his set, Casey received a call from the "law offices," leading to spontaneous laughter and confusion. He nonchalantly informed the crowd that Caitlyn Clark was picked first in the WNBA draft, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. The audience, Tony, and Daniel were in stitches as Casey reminisced about watching "MANswers" reruns and a childhood game of Truth or Dare where he kissed his best friend Barry. Casey's ability to blend bizarre humor with quick-thinking responses made this set unforgettable.

**2. Joseph Kirimi's Interview (Approx. 8:45 PM)**

Joseph Kirimi's interview was a rollercoaster ride of hilarity. He started by sharing his experiences with an OnlyFans girlfriend, but the real comedy gold came when he recounted a wild, Molly-fueled foursome in Las Vegas. Tony and Daniel eagerly probed Joseph for every juicy detail, leading to a back-and-forth banter that was pure comedy genius. Joseph, initially hesitant, eventually spilled the beans about the wildest thing he's ever done. The slow buildup and his awkward delivery made the punchline even funnier, and the room erupted when the story unfolded. The absurdity of the situation and Tony and Danielâ€™s witty commentary turned this moment into an instant classic.

**3. Maddy G's Hammock Antics (Approx. 9:00 PM)**

Maddy Gâ€™s explanation of his unique living situation involving a hammock was both awkward and side-splittingly funny. He painted a vivid picture of the challenges and oddities of navigating intimate moments in a hammock. The visual imagery alone was enough to elicit laughs, but Maddyâ€™s deadpan delivery and candidness took it to another level. Imagine Maddy describing how he sleeps in a hammock every night, complete with a sleeping bag. Tony and Daniel couldnâ€™t resist poking fun at the impracticality of it all. The real kicker came when Maddy explained the logistics of bringing a date back to his hammock. The image of two people trying to navigate intimacy in a swinging net was ridiculous and absolutely hilarious.
