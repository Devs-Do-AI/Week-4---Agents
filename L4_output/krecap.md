The absurdity reached new heights when he received a call mid-set from the "law offices," leading to spontaneous laughter and confusion. Casey's quick-thinking responses and the bizarre nature of the call made this moment one for the books. Picture this: Casey reminiscing about watching "MANswers" reruns and contemplating holiday politics while managing to weave in a story about kissing his best friend Barry during a childhood game of Truth or Dare. And just when you think it couldn't get any stranger, Casey's phone rings. He answers, nonchalantly informing the crowd that Caitlyn Clark was picked first in the WNBA draft. The absurdity of the situation had everyone, including Tony and Daniel, rolling with laughter. Casey's ability to blend surreal humor with spontaneous interactions made for an unforgettable set.

2. **Joseph Kirimi's Interview (Approx. 8:45 PM)**

Picture Maddy describing how he sleeps in a hammock every night, complete with a sleeping bag. Tony and Daniel couldn't resist poking fun at the impracticality of it all.
