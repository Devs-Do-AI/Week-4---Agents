people's dreams and hooking up with that
booger guy from the MX commercials
and and we both finish it's not that we
both finish
and I think I might be in love
and every time I start freaking out what
am I thinking what am I thinking getting
involved with this guy
[Laughter]
I got a [ __ ] family
man I'm the editor of the New Yorker for
Christ's
sakes every time I feel this little
slimy hand slipping
over right on the square of my back and
he sets me straight he
says it's okay
baby I love you baby
baby and I just fall to pieces thank you
I'm Casey
rocket
wow wow I feel like there was no jokes
there just
truth just a real sharing of a glimpse
in the life of Casey rocket uh hello
Casey how do you feel tonight awful
why awful why do you feel awful stressed
well I got to tell you I'm surprised you
didn't acknowledge it
uh maybe I missed it did you acknowledge
the fact that your eyelashes are
extremely plump and long lashes oh the
eyelashes I forgot I I
know I probably look like I haven't seen
my own bed in a couple days
uh I'll tell you what if you put
Pigtails in you'd be the girl from
wendes how about that
[Music]
we also fuing around thank you no it's
true that's for real I see it been an
awful week I stopped being a door guy
here I I graduated from being a door guy
and I've been really sad true that's
true the second ever door guy to retire
with Grace and following in the
footsteps of the great cam Patterson yes
every other door guy still waiting and
hoping to figure out how to graduate
from such a system you know what I'm a
bit mystified about though Tony H as a
door guy uh and this may be a fault in
your set as a dor gu I didn't hear one
[ __ ] knock knock
[Laughter]
joke I I got a knock knock joke let's
hear it okay knock knock who who's there
it's me baby
I should have [ __ ]
known he's
back got a knock knock joke let's hear
it knock knock who's there the lead
singer of Ario Speedwagon's
hair the lead singer of Aro speed
wagon's hair who well there's no ending
I'm not

actually knows AR you
Speedwagon we're very old
harlon well uh I did though so you did
yeah you nailed it yeah you guys were
around when speed wagons was the best
way to
travel so Casey here you are staring
down with long eyelashes pure retirement
of door guyism and what are your plans
moving forward uh what are you going to
do with all the free time that you have
for yourself
that's a good question
um well I thought of a couple things I
[Applause]
um my first plan now that I'm not a door
guy is throw up in fat man and make all
my friends clean it up
uh my second plan C clear Crispen wa's
Name by finding the real killer um oh my
God he's out there
third plan fighting the lead singer of
the chicks convinced them to change
their name back to the D Dixie Chicks
than assassinator for being racist
H and my final plan impressed jod Foster
by assassinating the guy who tried to
assassinate Ronald Reagan to impress her
wow a lot of murdering going on there's
a couple murders in there but I have
free time I've
never it's the first time I've ever seen
a man with a scroll with other paper on
top of the scroll are you trying to
reuse that scroll for something down the

[Music]
[Applause]
Mike how we doing
Mothership yeah we keeping it right huh
all right well yeah they call me bald
Mike uh it's not cuz I have cancer I
ain't dying don't worry uh I just got a
little alopecia you know what I mean a
little bit of that Jada pinket uh and
it's it's come in handy sometimes I got
it when I was young so I had like
patches of hair and it got all frizzy it
it looked horrible but uh it really came
in handy when my grandma died of all
times uh my parents after dealing with
all the [ __ ] they were like you know
what [ __ ] it let's go to Disney World
and when I was a kid I was like oh yay
Disney ah I was just like cool in
amusement park let's go went had a blast
it was a great time but on the plane
ride back uh my parents were like [ __ ]
it let's get loaded so they're just
getting rum and coke beers all that
[ __ ] left in [ __ ] right and uh
the second or third drink that they got
the stewardess came up to my mom and was
like list listen honey uh I know this
sounds weird but God told me that I need
to give you a hug and she's like is the
plane going down what the [ __ ] is
happening okay stands up you know gives
her the hug uh and it wasn't until two
weeks later that she realized like oh
[ __ ] that's probably because they
thought he was coming back from his make
a wish trip from Disney World dying ass
anyway that's my time okay bald mik this
is a very hairy situation we have here
looks like you could have shaved some of
the words out of those setups yeah
probably uh what do we think about this
guy I would roast him more but it looks
like he's already been roasted uh Tony
Hawk I like the uh punctuation with
dying ass to remind us thank you thank
you it is incredible I've never seen a
full-size sea monkey before this is
absolutely
incredible I'm Star Struck Harlin
Williams well I uh look what can we be
honest it it didn't go great
okay that's not a cut look I'm here to
Mentor these guys uh and I wanted to
bring this as the only comedian on the
stage with a degree from d in comedy
[Laughter]
oh wow is that made from the same scroll
Casey rocket used
earlier uh sometimes there are little
things you can do and I'm going to
Mentor this kid
here give me your last punchline of your
last joke and I'm going to show you a
little something you can do to kind of
pull the laughter from the crowd and
this is something Don Rin blat taught me
up at DeVry okay well admittedly I'm I'm
not a comic I don't really have a ton of
jokes I just had that story and I of
course I ran it long just tell me the
last sentence
yeah yeah he doesn't do comedy he
doesn't do improv very well know uh uh I
had a punchline that was uh fat people
architecture but I couldn't figure out
how to word it into a joke if you can
help me out what just say the last
sentence of the story you just said yeah
just say the last sentence of what you
said we are aware it wasn't funny say it
again
gotcha it wasn't until two weeks later
that she realized that oh [ __ ] that
might have been because they thought uh
he was on his make a wish trip back from
Disney World okay now watch what I'm
going to do for you here and this is
something I learned up at night school
at D does it does say d night school
August 11th 2014 Don Rin blat signed
it here he is Harland Williams fixing
bald Mike's non-existent punch so
sometimes when things are so silent you
could hear two crickets uh sniffing a
cornbread
fart what you do and this is what they
taught me you pull a goofy face so I'm
going to do your last line and
watch uh so my parents uh said this
might be my uh takeaway trip to
Disneyland damn that's amazing shh I'm
not [ __ ]

up for the show tonight why why are you
here where did you come from do you live

come up here was I was going to see if
you could come up with any new roasts

heard before but I've got a couple
favorites I've heard in the past what
why don't you do some of the jokes that

that sounds fun and then I'll know and
then I'll know what I can eliminate off
of my list cuz I have a lot here that
are Head and Shoulders above anything

have but you go ahead let's hear some of
your best ones so that you don't call me
a hack afterwards all fair enough fair

other annoying [ __ ]
now it's a one to one ratio if you have
autism you're bisexual they don't
explain why but I have a theory I think
it's cuz [ __ ] is like the coolest
fidget spinner you could ever get your
hands on and just like a real fidget
spinner I don't really know how they
work but I will put my whole mouth on it
so I said that joke to my cooworker the
other day and she liked it she laughed
it was fine but then she just looked at
me and she was like oh and she was like
but are you you're not going to is
you're going to say that on stage isn't
your dad coming to the show and I was
like first of all no do I look like
someone with a supportive father no I
don't I look like the PornHub version of
Sarah Huckabee Sanders that's what I
[ __ ] look
like homeless guy told me that
yesterday which was crazy I was like how
do you know what was she on like the
front cover of your blanket like how do
you know who the [ __ ] that
is where'd you run into her thank
you Josie Marcelino making her kill Tony
debut welcome excited to have you here
this is uh this makes three comedians in
a row with drawn on eyebrows this is
very exciting
this is the a first in Kill Tony history
you would think 11 years the tens of
thousands of bucket PS this must have
happened before never before welcome to
the show you have an incredible energy
to you uh what do you do for a living uh
I am an associate producer of a TV show
oh wow I signed an NDA so I don't like
to get into like specifics of it but
love on the Spectrum we know yeah yeah
okay so autistic and bisexual is that
true that is what are some of your
autistic tra I know every country's flag
and I'm I'm really into them really yeah
okay how about Trinidad and Tobago it's
a red and white stripe diagonal flag wow
yeah absolutely incredible how about the
transgenders what like their flag or
like just them in general what do I
think either
[Laughter]
one it's a win-win
situation well the FL is the cool you
know it's the blue and the white and the
pink and I'll keep my thoughts to myself
everything's fine no I love them I love
them all right hell yeah absolutely Ian
I it looks like you're wearing a
flag is incredible Slovakia am I correct
is that close no no it's this more of a
red flag FL it is Trinidad and Tobago
actually Red Band flip that around show
the people that's incredible it actually
is look at that holy [ __ ] actually is
similar yeah what are the odds W it was
a trick all along I knew the flag of
Trinidad and Tobago and I all right okay
uh autistic and bisexual who if you had
to guess I always ask the bisexual
people this are you 5050 what do you do
you have a preference is there one when
you get drunk that you gravitate towards
what's the deal with your bisexuality
I've never understood it before what
were you going to oh you look like you
had a followup no go ahead I think for
me like sexual attraction 50/50 but like
in terms of relationships is mostly guys
why do you think that is I'm a nightmare
I can't have a second one of me right
that's crazy if you're autistic and
bisexual does that mean you don't make
eye contact when you eat [ __ ] yeah
never absolutely and that's the best
part about it you just go down there and
do your business are you making eye
contact when you eat [ __ ] yes that's
horrible do you have
any no you got to make harland's
face I we have bad news for you buddy
you're eating them upside
[Applause]
[Laughter]

laugh as an as an autistic person have
have we and I hope some of you have we

decid to do this what made you do it
yeah sure anything yeah I uh like a year
ago I just you said and this is you've
this is your first time signing up yeah
uh no I signed up like early February
and you didn't get up no and here you
are here I am and this is what you
prepared
[Laughter]
for this is what I prepared for yes okay
I'm just curious why do the questions
keep coming after she said she was
delusional that's a good point I know
he's trying to squeeze a dry orange over
here it appears Helena what do you do
for a living I'm
[Laughter]
orange what do you do for a living I'm
an electrician you're an electrician oh
that explains the hair yeah
yeah that [ __ ] call the rain
toide did your hair go to Def fry comedy
it is unbelievable you are an
electrician obviously not that great at
your job um you've been shocked before
am I correct I have been yeah many times
no just twice just twice okay absolutely
okay so what made you write an ultra
racist set tonight that's a good point
you know I was thinking about it and I
just kind of wanted to go edgy I don't
know what do you have against black
people is it because your lips are so
small yes
it is a little bit of the Envy aspect I
would say I also have the flattest ass
that there is so yeah there you look
like the Wicked Witch of the West Side
you know what I'm saying it through the
glass have you ever been with a black
man no have you ever been on a date with
a black man no have you ever even said
hello to a black man I have while not
working yes I have do you have any black
friends yes I do name your black friends
first names only go ahead starting now
Irwin he's my brother-in-law oh that
doesn't count actual friends not
relatives nice and easy on the music so
that we can hear go ahead rattle them
off here we go all your black friends
Helena's welcome to another episode of
Helena's black friends and
go Mao is a black friend um this is a
really good question no um black people
don't like me there you go I wonder why
that is we should ever call Mao and say
those jokes to him on the phone how do
you know Macio huh how do you know Mao
we went to Elementary and like all
through like when's the last time you
talked to Mao honestly like a few years
ago I think like four or five
years this is incredible dude yeah we're
not
tight I'm from
Utah what I just moved here from Utah
okay so that's why I'm not there has not
that many black people there Utah
famously light on the black people
1.6% black people in Utah I know this we
looked it up cam Patterson wrote a joke
about it it's funny completely I don't
know anything about funny so I know I
know very good uh Helena Before I Let
You Go what's the most interesting thing
about you or your life that would uh
surprise us or we would find interesting
at all I think probably the most
interesting thing about my life is I go
back to the same place in my dreams like
80 to 90% of the time

a that is true that is true I see you
eyeballing the goat Tony Haw oh my gosh
Tony it is so nice to meet you I just
met you up there you were growing up you
caused a lot of Heartache honestly in my
family my mom was quite the hypochondria
she was just this crazy woman kind of
and I was never allowed to skateboard
but I looked up to you so much so it
really it just caused a lot of pain it
caused a lot of strife knowing I thank
you that you could play video games and
and immate what we do yeah safer I know
the video games are like 1080 I was a
big uh uh fan of the snowboarding
game that cuz I wasn't allowed to
skateboard so then I went real hard in
the snowboarding game genre but cuz the
skateboarding game was too dangerous is
that what you're saying correct I just
wasn't allowed to my mom had these rules
I wasn't allowed to skateboard so
because of that I honestly think it
really left this weird hole in my heart
so I just played I I love 1080 he was
really he was I got that he was a great
snowboarder you might recognize him this
is Sean F's
