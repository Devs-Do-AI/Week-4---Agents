wow that was so much better than I
expected it to be when I first saw you

to be wacky and weird but I didn't think
it would be fantastic that was a good
set I love it you the bomb bomb part at
the end little bit you know a little bit
easy for compared to the rest of your
set but it was fantastic Sherry how long
you been on standup um this uh last time
since uh last May but I used to do
standup years ago uh AOS how does it
feel to have your grandmother up
here I I swear to God I felt like my mom
was up there I got so happy you see me
smile I have one question when you came
out and you said boo to the audience you
screamed at one guy boo did you mean to
say Jew that's what I've been trying to
figure out I think you misspoke I think
you missed a punch I don't take
sides you are something else how long
you been in America uh since 78 before
you were born that is true that is true
how old were you in 78 uh 13 okay and
where did you guys move to uh Northern
California I went to high school there
then went to school in Fresno State and
you've only been doing it for a year U I
used to do stand up from 97 to 2003 and
then and it was a little bit too messed
up up here so I needed to step back and
kind of clean upan and and what do you
mean by
that this is Dr Phil he can help you
perhaps you've heard of Dr Phil cuz
we're all a little messed up upstairs
you know and I talk about that in my
book we've got
issues we've all we've all been knocked
down and we're trying to get up again
who said that jum W but you got it
you're never going to keep him down so
so Sherry uh when you're not dressing
like a Sesame Street
character do you have uh do you have
hobbies how do you keep your head clean
of negative thoughts I I meditate I got
therapy I took classes what kind of
classes um spiritual classes like what
um regression past life regression and
stuff like that okay so it was all in
the past life you've had some childhood
trauma and whatnot yeah was this all
before you moved to America or was it
probably when when I was in my mom 's
womb yeah oh okay your mom's womb yeah
right how long have you been doing
standup uh since last May right you just
started uh kind of but I used to do
standup years ago in Iran uh no
no okay well where the [ __ ] did you
start standup Sherry in LA in La great
well you're very funny thank you do you
what what's your writing process like um
I talk to myself um uh during the day
and then stuff downloads and I write it
because her husband doesn't allow her to
read or write so she has to talk to
herself that was funny okay
granny that's cool
so so all uh your material comes
from Wow Tony you might you might get a
spot on the secret show for that joke
uhoh uhoh the roof oh wait we can't any
higher cuz the ceilings are so high it's
high enough for Sherry to fly a Boe 747
into
[Laughter]
it so Sherry I love it are you married

Iranian [ __ ] Mountain cougar just out
here I love it try to get to the younger

be in a world of your
imagination take a

nerve-wracking thing to come up here no

other things on on a stage before
performance- wise I did a little bit of
um acting when I was in LA of course and

perhaps uh uh one of the uh Al-Qaeda
terrorist
videos uh maybe the mother of an
Al-Qaeda

a while it may brown guys only for me to
recognize what the junk looks like yeah

your ideal guy you said younger but do
you need like a physically fit guy cuz
some girls earen a dad bods right I like

you think you're going to find a full
grown vegan
boy
tall
muscular I want someone better than me
you want someone what better than me a
that's sweet my standards are kind of so
let me ask you something cuz you have it
all together here but seems like you
have to do a lot and uh you know a lot
of different things to keep your mental
health proper which is a very common
thing amongst funny people um have you
ever when's the last time you ate
meat um this last round about two years
ago and did that do anything to your
brain did you feel better for a second
there eating what you're supposed to eat
as a human being on planet
Earth boy somebody listens to Joe Rogan
huh
listens listens he's right right though
meat is better it helps your body okay
and I talk about that in chapter 11 meat
helps your body suck a [ __ ] from time to
time and see what your see what your
brain comes up with that's chapter 12
and 13 I'm not completely off meat oh so
you'll eat some meat when when I have a
boyfriend oh so have a boy
okay look out okay now that we're here
how do you start you're in the bedroom
what's your first
move for real cuz there might be a guy
out there listening right now now it's
like I need to know if Sherry means
business I need to know if heavy petting
is involved if anal is first base or
third
base where do you like to start Sherry
take me through it we got time a nice
dinner yeah I'm already out so I think
that
there's yeah you lost me at food and
taking you for [ __ ] that I got to pay
for no I'm joking oh [ __ ] you Sherry we
have a guy we have a guy on the line
right now that uh wants to say something
perhaps an eligible bachelor let's see
has to say I love hemp protein it's one
of my favorite proteins for we sell it
on it we sell hemp
protein how about that guy he never
calls in either that was special he the
owner of the club Joe Rogan talking
about how he loves hemp protein oh okay
okay not impressed my guess is he's not
tall enough for
Sherry tall
order well Sherry I just came out with
these Dr Phil hoodies uh that you guys

Sherry
[Applause]
amazing wow ladies and gentlemen we have
a special treat for you right now a very
very special treat before there were
golden ticket winners on this show you
know it still exists did the show
started 11 years ago and I think it was
about jeez 6 seven8 years ago we found
this guy probably closer to seven or
eight years ago we pulled this man out
of the bucket maybe longer was in the
belly room I remember that very clearly
and uh he went on he's been on to great
success uh sells out theaters all around
the [ __ ] world he was originally just
literally one of the best bucket pulls
ever from way back in the day I told him
you're going to be a star not nothing
can stop you and he's nice enough to
Grace us with a brand new minute for the
first time in absolute many years ladies
and gentlemen you know him from
America's Got Talent and so many other
great things make some noise for the
great preacher
[Applause]
[Music]
Lawson all
right all
right all right all right thank you
thank you
uh I think that women avoid eye contact
with dudes cuz if they look at us for
like two seconds we just assume they
like us you have one second and you got
to get out of there ladies 1 1,000 go
save yourself cuz in a man's brain we
like 1 1,000 to you're like a dream come
true that's what we think you got to go
it's so funny if a woman looks at a man
for two seconds we like oh she want it
but if a man looks at another man for 2
seconds we like you trying to fight bro
who you looking at for two seconds
unless they're gay but you know if
they're gay or not because their chin is
down
right you can tell that's the giveaway
right there same rules apply 1 1000 whoa
hey whoa
whoa yeah I've never had a boyfriend in
my
life I don't even know why I told y'all
that but I haven't had one I haven't had
a gay roommate one time he didn't say he

thing that we cuz there was no females

regular at the time or a golden ticket

the format of the show yet we were lucky

people signing up but back then it was

can you teach me how to shoot a
basketball you're putting words in my
mouth Tony okay I'll put something in
your mouth and you know what it is oh
[Applause]
[Music]

special name to remember my name is

that um why you called your special my
name is preacher I I named it my well
first off it's my name right I know that
and then and yeah I just think that
that's what it ENC capsules my name but
is there a joke uh yeah I do a joke
about it do a joke I do a joke about my
name being preacher right yeah great
it's great branding it is great brand
well it's a tough thing to title
something like that like for we've got
issues I just go I said well what are we
all trying to overcome issues and who's
trying to overcome them we are right so
maybe you guys can stop [ __ ] ganging
up on me and just answer a simple
[ __ ] question you highflying black
guy
now am I on a hidden camera show I'm
about to [ __ ] bring out Sherry and
[ __ ] her in front of everybody if you
don't start if you don't start shaping
up and shipping out I'm sorry preacher
yeah you know I love you I'm just trying
to [ __ ] you know I wanted you to you
know share the love of your special I
didn't know that was the actual do a fi
book man a real B now is he sponsoring
you what is this man yeah I had it made
especially for this bit no this is a
it's a real book pretty sure that I uh
that I wrote
so let's stick to the script player
that's awesome
man wait but uh how long you been doing
stand up again uh 15 years 15 years it
feels like yeah is there a time when it
gets easier or is it just the grind of
it always pretty consistent I feel like
everything's always hard you know I feel
if it's too easy I think I'm getting
lazy you know what I mean so I
completely agree I think a comedian is
always in competition with themselves to
get better and uh you know to try to
impress an audience in a city that maybe
saw you a year ago or a year and a half
or whatever it is before you go back
it's like that's the thing yeah cuz if

sad even the [ __ ] ads are
sad click on a porn video the ad comes
on are you horny and
alone
yeah why are you attacking me I'm using
your website
D it's the only business that does that
like imagine went to McDonald's like oh

amazing what a fantastic minute Pedro
Franco welcome to the show thank you
this is your first time on the show
correct yeah first time I would remember
you you have a you have a whole thing to
you yeah the the the couple weeks ago
right two weeks I think uh Shane was
drinking and I ran into him in the
street remember that no you don't
remember that why do people bring up
random things I thought that's what
you're talking about yeah I was hanging
out with u a friend of mine do hold on
just stop sorry you're saying that you
ran into me and Shane on the street yeah
it was super random yeah no it's not
random sometimes we walk on the street

uh I was just saying welcome to the show
thank you how long you been doing
standup comedy uh 6 months 6 months

pretty much incredible you know it's
it's funny because uh I always thought
those ads before porn were like like
crazy but I never really had an angle on
it it's one of the first times in
Forever where I can honestly say I'm
kind of jealous of that bit like that's
like kind of amazing it's right there on
the
surface but yeah what the [ __ ] those ads
are crazy it we're blatantly horny and
alone they don't got to like highlight
that you know that's the whole thing
yeah yeah it's it's like they're [ __ ]
with us pretty are you overwhelmed with
[ __ ]
like no I'm about to jerk
off it's pretty blatant that's a great
take though that's what I'm saying is
you have a very natural uh you know it's
right there on the surface Brazilian
porn is a teally one of my favorite
categories it's but I I don't just type
in Brazilian I need like layers so it's

Hillary Clinton said that if Trump wins
the election he'll start killing his
enemies which is honestly a little
ironic cuz if there's one thing that
[ __ ] knows about it's killing your
enemies
[ __ ] I don't know if y'all have been
following the Trump trial up in New York
but Trump's case went up in Flames last
week wait no it wasn't Trump's case but
the dumbass protester who set himself on
fire in front of the
courthouse but seriously that gallon of
gas cost the guy 8 and5 dollar so if he
would have just waited until Trump got
reelected he could have burned himself
up for half that
much okay that's my time thank
you huge bre to close all four people at
the table clapping with their hands up
at the same time almost seems like uh
this next election's a no brainer uh
William an unbelievable set you did it

[ __ ] Civil War but wasn't and you're
a big fan obviously of the Confederacy

moving

it seems like the interview portion this
evening is a little bit serious a little
bit dramatic so you know what maybe we
should do I think maybe you should have
a seat at the table and maybe we put a
ribbon on this episode with a brand new
minute from I don't know maybe just
maybe the
2023 guest of the year and a guy and a
guy I don't know I don't want to make
any bold predictions but I would say off
