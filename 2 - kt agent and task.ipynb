      "\n",
      "Welcome back, comedy aficionados! The latest episode of Kill Tony was a rollicking ride through the unpredictable world of open-mic comedy, complete with unexpected twists, high-energy performances, and the kind of wild stories that only come from the minds of stand-up comedians. Let's dive right into the highlights of this unforgettable episode.\n",

      "#### The Opening Act: David Jolly Kicks Things Off\n",
      "The night began with America's favorite uncle, David Jolly, who celebrated his 43rd birthday with a brand new minute. Jolly, who has the unique ability to blend sharp wit with self-deprecating humor, didn't disappoint. His set touched on everything from PBS's influence on his childhood to the first gay couple he ever saw on TV — Bert and Ernie. The highlight? A hilarious recount of his layover-filled journey back from St. Louis, underscoring his thriftiness.\n",

      "2. **A Armstrong** captured the crowd with his unique look and backstory, revealing that he got a face tattoo after a divorce and was raised by monkeys in Japan. His impersonation of a monkey was an instant hit.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Solomon Craft** shared his wild tales from a year-long motorcycle trip through South America, including a harrowing encounter with escorts in Colombia. His candid recounting of a drunken night in Germany with a trans woman had the audience in stitches.\n",

      "#### Uncle Laser's Return\n",

      "#### The Grand Finale: Hans Kim\n",
      "The night concluded with the return of Hans Kim, a beloved regular whose deadpan delivery and honest storytelling never fail to entertain.
