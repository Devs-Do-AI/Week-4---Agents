Tony Hinchcliffe: "Hey everyone, welcome back to Kill Tony! Let's give it up for our brave comedian! So, you mentioned you killed a cactus. How did that happen? Did you forget to water it or overwater it? Give us the full story."

Comedian: "Oh man, killing a cactus is like failing a test where the only question is your name! I mean, you know you're bad with plants when even a cactus gives up on you. So here's the story: I got this cute little cactus, thinking it would be the perfect low-maintenance plant. Turns out, I overestimated my ability to do absolutely nothing. I either forgot to water it for months, or I overdid it and turned it into a tiny desert swamp. One day, I came home, and it was just slumped over, looking like it had given up on life. I can almost hear it saying, 'Really? You had one job!' Now I stick to fake plants. Even they look nervous."

Tony Hinchcliffe: "That's hilarious. You know you're a bad plant parent when even a cactus taps out. So, online dating, huh? Sounds like you’ve been on some real winners. What’s the worst date you’ve ever been on? Give us the juicy details."

Comedian: "Oh man, the worst date I've ever been on was like something out of a bad rom-com. I met this girl on a dating app, and we decided to meet at this trendy little cafe. When I got there, she was already seated, and to my surprise, she had brought her cat. I'm not talking about in a carrier either; this cat was just chilling on the table like it owned the place.

Things started off awkwardly, but I was trying to roll with it. Then, mid-conversation, she casually mentioned that she believes in 'cat astrology' and started explaining how her cat's astrological sign affects its personality. I couldn't believe it. I was stuck there, nodding along, while she compared her cat's traits to those of famous historical figures.

The final straw was when the cat knocked over my coffee, and she said, 'Oh, it's just Mercury in retrograde.' I knew I had to get out of there. I made up an excuse about having an early morning and bolted. Needless to say, there was no second date."

Tony Hinchcliffe: "That's brutal. Cat astrology? That's a new one. So you joined a gym to 'not die during a workout.' What was your first day like? Did you survive, or did you need a stretcher?"

Comedian: "Oh man, my first day at the gym was a disaster. I walked in there thinking, 'Alright, let's not die today.' But, you know, as soon as I saw those exercise machines, they looked like medieval torture devices! I was so intimidated. I hopped on the treadmill, and it felt like I was running from my problems—except my problems were keeping up with me at 10 miles per hour.

Then, I tried lifting weights. Bad idea. I thought I could handle it, but I ended up looking like a baby giraffe trying to stand for the first time. My arms were shaking so much, I thought I'd need a stretcher to carry me out.

But hey, I survived! Barely. Walked out of there looking like I'd been through a war zone, but at least I didn't die. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? Well, I'm still waiting for the stronger part."

Tony Hinchcliffe: "Haha, that's fantastic. You mentioned becoming a motivational speaker for houseplants if comedy doesn't work out. What would be your first motivational speech to a room full of plants?"

Comedian: "Hello, my leafy friends! Gather around, gather around. I know you might be thinking, 'What could this human possibly have to say to us?' Well, let me tell you, I am here to inspire you to be-leaf in yourselves!

You know, some people say, 'You're just a houseplant.' But I say, 'You grow, girl!' Just because you’re rooted in one spot doesn't mean you can't reach for the stars—or at least the ceiling.

Remember, every plant has its own pace. Some of you might be blooming right now, while others are just sprouting. But don't worry, even the mightiest oak was once just a little nut that held its ground.

And hey, don't be afraid to shed some leaves. It's not losing; it's just making room for new growth. We've all been there. Sometimes you have to let go of the old to make way for the new.

So, keep soaking up that sunshine, keep reaching for the sky, and always remember: You're not just surviving; you're thriving! Ready, set, grow!

Now, let's get out there and show those succulents who’s boss. You've got this! Photosynthesis on three. One, two, three—photosynthesis!"

Tony Hinchcliffe: "That was awesome! Let's hear it one more time for our comedian, folks! Keep killing it out there, but maybe stay away from the cacti."
