"Hey everyone, I’m so excited to be here on Kill Tony! You know, I’m at that age where my friends are all getting married or having kids. I’m just trying to keep my houseplants alive. Seriously, I killed a cactus once. A cactus! How do you kill something that’s designed to survive in the desert? It’s like the Chuck Norris of plants, and I’m the villain in a bad action movie.

Speaking of bad decisions, I recently tried online dating. Man, online dating is just like shopping at a thrift store. You’re sifting through a bunch of questionable options, hoping to find something that doesn’t smell like desperation. My last date told me she’s 'spiritual but not religious.' Turns out, that’s code for 'owns a lot of crystals and talks to the moon.' I spent the whole evening wondering if I was on a date or a quest for the Holy Grail.

I also tried to get into shape. I joined a gym, and the first thing the trainer asked was, ‘What’s your fitness goal?’ I said, ‘To not die during this workout.’ I mean, have you ever seen those exercise machines? They look like medieval torture devices. I’m pretty sure I saw one in a Game of Thrones episode.

But hey, at least I’m here, giving it my best shot. If comedy doesn’t work out, I can always become a motivational speaker for houseplants. ‘You too can survive! Just avoid my apartment!’

Thanks, everyone, you’ve been great!"
