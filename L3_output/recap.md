**Kill Tony Episode Recap: A Rollercoaster of Absurdity and Roasting**

1. **Casey Rocket’s Chaotic Comedy (Approx. 13:00)**
   - **Context**: Casey Rocket kicked off the episode with an absurd and chaotic set that had everyone laughing and scratching their heads simultaneously. He dived deep into the world of "inceptioning" people and hooking up with characters from commercials. Imagine trying to explain that to your therapist.
   - **Highlight**: Tony and the guests couldn't help but riff on Casey’s long eyelashes and his recent, um, "promotion" from being a door guy. The banter was as sharp as Casey’s hypothetical eyelashes.
   - **Line**: "I probably look like I haven't seen my own bed in a couple days." Casey's self-awareness is as refreshing as it is hilarious.

2. **Bald Mike’s Alopecia Antics (Approx. 33:00)**
   - **Context**: Enter Bald Mike, a comedian with alopecia who shared a story that was both tragic and hysterical. People mistook him for a Make-A-Wish kid, and the panel was ruthless in their roasting.
   - **Highlight**: Tony, never one to miss a comedic opportunity, drew an eyebrow and the word "gay" on Bald Mike’s forehead. It's the kind of thing you'd expect at a frat house, not a comedy show, but that's Kill Tony for you.
   - **Line**: "She is watching from two different rooms." A zinger that landed perfectly, referencing someone potentially watching the show from two different TV screens due to the confusion caused by Mike's alopecia.

3. **Helena’s Edgy Set (Approx. 57:00)**
   - **Context**: Helena took to the stage with a set that walked the line between bold and, well, controversial. She tackled topics like slavery and black people, making everyone collectively hold their breath.
   - **Highlight**: The panel, especially Tony and Harland, didn’t shy away from roasting her. They questioned her real-life interactions with black people, making for a hilarious yet uncomfortable exchange.
   - **Line**: "Have you ever even said hello to a black man?" Tony’s line had the audience in stitches, perfectly encapsulating the awkwardness of Helena’s set.

4. **David Lucas vs. Harland Williams: The Roast Battle (Approx. 1:47:00)**
   - **Context**: David Lucas, a Kill Tony Hall of Famer, took on guest Harland Williams in a roasting session that could only be described as rapid-fire hilarity. The jokes flew faster than a turkey on Thanksgiving.
   - **Highlight**: The back-and-forth was relentless, with each comedian trying to outdo the other. It was a masterclass in comedic timing and wit.
   - **Line**: "You look like a protected turkey." David Lucas’s line hit hard and had everyone laughing, painting a vivid and ridiculous picture of Harland.

5. **William Montgomery’s Absurdity and Jelly Roll’s Surprise (Approx. 2:05:00)**
   - **Context**: William Montgomery, known for his mix of absurd and dark humor, delivered a set that included a joke about Lizzo causing eclipses. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, Jelly Roll made a surprise appearance.
   - **Highlight**: Jelly Roll’s performance was the cherry on top, engaging the audience in a sing-along that perfectly contrasted William’s dark humor.
   - **Line**: "During my last tour of Afghanistan, I came face to face with a jihottie." William’s line was both unexpected and hilarious, epitomizing his unique comedic style.
