**Kill Tony Episode Recap: A Rollercoaster of Absurdity and Roasting**

---

1. **Casey Rocket’s Chaotic Comedy (Approx. 13:00)**

   The episode hits the ground running with Casey Rocket, who storms the stage like a caffeinated raccoon. Casey’s set is a whirlwind of non-sequiturs and bizarre observations that leave the audience both confused and in stitches. His unique brand of humor involves a lot of physical comedy—think wild gestures and exaggerated facial expressions. At one point, he compares his love life to a feral cat: "I feed it scraps, and it still bites me!" The crowd eats it up, and Casey exits the stage with the energy of a Tasmanian devil on Red Bull.

2. **Bald Mike’s Alopecia Antics (Approx. 33:00)**

   Next up is Bald Mike, who turns his alopecia into comedy gold. With a shiny dome and a sharper wit, he dives into the trials and tribulations of being hairless in a world obsessed with hair. "I save a fortune on shampoo," he quips, "but I can’t tell if my barber is talented or just polite." He even jokes about how he’s the perfect candidate for head massages but gets weird looks at petting zoos. By the end of his set, the audience is laughing so hard they’re nearly bald themselves.

3. **Helena’s Edgy Set (Approx. 57:00)**

   Helena steps onto the stage with an air of edgy confidence, ready to push some boundaries. Her set is a daring mix of social commentary and personal anecdotes. She tackles sensitive topics with a sharp tongue and a fearless attitude. One standout line has her riffing on modern dating: "Swipe left if you’re a serial killer. Swipe right if you’re just misunderstood." Helena’s unapologetic humor is a hit, leaving the audience thinking and laughing in equal measure.

4. **David Lucas vs. Harland Williams: The Roast Battle (Approx. 1:47:00)**

   The stakes get high with the much-anticipated roast battle between David Lucas and Harland Williams. David kicks things off with a searing jab: "Harland looks like the guy who got kicked out of the band Nickelback for not being cool enough." Harland fires back, "David’s so big, his shadow has a gravitational pull." The roasts fly fast and furious, each more brutal and hilarious than the last. By the end of it, it’s hard to tell who’s the winner because the audience is the real victor, doubled over in laughter.

5. **William Montgomery’s Absurdity and Jelly Roll’s Surprise (Approx. 2:05:00)**

   Just when you think the episode can’t get any wilder, William Montgomery takes the stage, bringing his signature brand of absurdity. He rambles about everything from conspiracy theories to his love for mayonnaise. "People think the moon landing was faked," he says, "but I’m more concerned about the fake mayonnaise industry!" The cherry on top? Jelly Roll makes a surprise appearance, joining William for an impromptu duet about, you guessed it, mayonnaise. It’s bizarre, it’s hilarious, and it’s the perfect way to end the episode.
