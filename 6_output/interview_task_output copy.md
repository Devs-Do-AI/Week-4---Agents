**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "Hey everyone, I just moved to Austin, and let me tell you, the BBQ here is so good, it almost made me forget how much I pay in rent."

**Comedian:** "Dating in the digital age is wild. Dating apps have made it so much easier... to hate dating. Swipe left, swipe right... it's like Tinder is just a game of 'Hot or Not' for people with commitment issues. I mean, if I wanted to judge people based on their looks alone, I'd just go back to high school."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "Alright, let's dive into that. So, you're using Tinder, huh? How's that working out for you? Swipe left on too many BBQ lovers yet?"

**Comedian:** "Oh, absolutely. It's a mess out there. Sometimes I feel like I'm just swiping left on the same person over and over again."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "I hear you. You know, back in Youngstown, Ohio, we didn't have Tinder. We had to swipe left on people in person. Much harder to do when they're standing right in front of you. But let's get into this reality TV show household of yours. Three siblings, huh? Who was the worst to live with?"

**Comedian:** "Oh, definitely my younger brother. He'd hog the bathroom for hours. It was like he was filming his own reality show in there."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "Sounds rough. Growing up with siblings is like living in a perpetual roast battle. You have to be sharp or you'll get eaten alive. Any epic sibling fights you remember?"

**Comedian:** "Oh yeah, we fought over everything. TV remotes, who got the last slice of pizza, you name it. One time, we had a full-on wrestling match over who got to use the new shampoo first."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "That's hilarious. You know, in my house, the only thing we fought over was survival. Youngstown is like the Thunderdome of Ohio. So, what inspired you to get into comedy? Any specific moment where you thought, 'Yeah, this is what I want to do'?"

**Comedian:** "Honestly, it was watching stand-up specials on TV. Seeing those comedians just kill it on stage, I thought, 'I want to do that.' Plus, making people laugh is the best feeling in the world."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "Absolutely, there's nothing like it. And now you're here, killing it on Kill Tony. So, tell me, what's next for you? Any big plans?"

**Comedian:** "Just keep grinding, hitting as many open mics as I can, and hopefully start getting some bigger gigs. The dream is to have my own special one day."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "Well, you're on the right path. Keep it up, and one day you'll look back and laugh at all those swipes and sibling fights. Thanks for coming up, and keep working on those jokes. Life is always interesting, especially when you can turn it into comedy."

**Tony Hinchcliffe:** "So yeah, between the BBQ, the dating apps, and my siblings, life is pretty interesting. Thanks, Austin, for making it all a little more delicious and a lot more expensive!"
