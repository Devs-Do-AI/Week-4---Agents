"So, I recently joined a dating app. You guys ever use these things? It's like shopping for people, right? Swipe left, swipe rightâ€”it's digital window shopping! But the profiles, oh my God. I saw one that said, 'Looking for my partner in crime.' Really? Are we robbing banks now? And what's with the dog pictures? Like, 'This is Max. If he doesn't approve of you, it's a no-go.' Great, now I have to impress a dog to get a date. And then there's the messaging. One guy sent me a GIF of a penguin falling on ice. I mean, what am I supposed to do with that? Are we bonding over clumsy birds now? It's a jungle out there, folks. Dating has turned into a weird game of who can out-weird the other. Swipe right if you agree!"

This set should resonate with the audience, as it touches on the relatable and often absurd aspects of modern dating apps. The humor is lighthearted but sharp, and the imagery is vivid enough to engage the crowd.
